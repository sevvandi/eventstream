Description: Implements event extraction and early classification of events in data streams in R. 
    It has the functionality to generate 2-dimensional data streams with events belonging to 
    2 classes. These events can be extracted and features computed. The event features extracted
    from incomplete-events can be classified using a partial-observations-classifier
