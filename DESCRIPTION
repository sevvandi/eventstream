Description: An implementation of streaming events and their early classification in R. 
    It has the functionality to generate 2-dimensional data streams with events belonging to 
    2 classes. These events can be extracted and features computed. The event features extracted
    from incomplete-events can be classified using a partial-observations-classifier which includes
    a L2 penalty.
